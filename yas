## Information

<details>
  <summary><h3>How to use</h3></summary>
  
  There are 2 good methods to using these scripts:
  1. Copying the main GUI and running it in the inspect element console
  2. Copying the .min.js GUI and using it as a bookmarklet
  
<details>
  <summary>What can I do if JavaScript is blocked?</summary>
  We don't actually know what to do about this or how to fix it, sorry.
</details>
</details>



<details><summary><h3>(script) is not working?</h3></summary>

Make sure you're running it properly (see [How to use](https://github.com/swagging-post/Blooket-Cheeto#how-to-use)), if it still doesn't work and other cheats do, then [make an issue](https://github.com/swagging-post/Blooket-Cheeto/issues)
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Which script should I use to make a bookmarklet?</h3></summary>

You should use the scripts ending in ".min.js", as using the others will have errors due to formatting.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Can you give me infinite tokens / bypass daily limit / permanently give me blooks / change pack luck?</h3></summary>

No, these are things we would've already done if they were possible, they're managed on the backend of Blooket so we can't modify them
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Can you make hacks for (game)</h3></summary>

No
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Can you make more Battle Royale cheats</h3></summary>

Battle Royale is a gamemode that works almost entirely on the host's end. The only thing we have control over is answering questions.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>What happened to Minesraft2 and 05Konz?</h3></summary>

Minesraft2 was sent a cease and desist from Blooket and 05Konz was perm banned, so I took over since they wouldn't be able to and try to fix the cheats.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h3>How do I do this on mobile?</h3></summary>
  
  These scripts aren't made for mobile, so we don't really know how to get them to work on it.
  
  <details>
    <summary><h3>What's the Mobile GUI?</h3></summary>
    The mobile GUI is the first GUI Minesraft2 ever made. Some people said it worked on mobile and it's a lot neater for mobile use apparently so we just called it that.
